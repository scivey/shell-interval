# shell-interval

####`setInterval` for the command line.

---

```
npm install -g shell-interval
```

```Shell
$   shell-interval -t 5 -c "echo Hello." -r 3

Hello.      # 0:05
Hello.      # 0:10
Hello.      # 0:15
            # [stop]
```
```js
var shellInterval = require("shell-interval");
shellInterval({
    options: {
        command: "echo ten seconds has passed",
        time: 10,
        reps: 5,
    },
    onExec: function(err, stdout, stderr) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(stdout);
    },
    onFinish: function() {
        console.log("The shell command was called five times. Exiting...");
    },
        
});
```



## Shell Usage

####Parameters
* __-c, --command__ :       
    The quote-delimited shell command to execute.
* __-t, --time__    :   
    The second interval between calls
* __-r, --reps__    :   
    The number of times to execute the command.  Default is infinite.
* __-q, --quiet__   :   
    Don't log stdout to the terminal. (boolean flag)
* __-e, --eager__ :     
    Execute the shell command once immediately, before starting the timer. (boolean flag)

#### Examples

* `shell-interval -c "[command]" -t 2` : Execute the `[command]` every ~ two seconds indefinitely, until a kill signal is received. (e.g. `^c`)

* `shell-interval -c "[command]" -t 5 -r 10` : Execute the `[command]` every ~five seconds until the command has been called ten times, and then exit.  `Command` is first invoked ~five seconds after the call to `shell-interval`.

* `shell-interval -c "[command]" -t 5 -r 10 -e` : Execute the `[command]` every ~five seconds until the command has been called ten times, and then exit.  Because the `-e` (`--eager`) flag was passed, the command is first executed as soon as node finishes initializing the script.

##Node API

The `shell-interval` module exports a single function with the same options as its command-line interface as well as hooks for two callbacks.  These callbacks can handle data returned from the shell calls (`onExec`) and perform any necessary cleanup after a finite series of shell calls has completed (`onFinish`).
```js
var shellInterval = require("shell-interval");
var timeout_id = shellInterval({
    options: /* object */ ,
    
    onExec: /* callback function */,
    
    onFinish: /* callback function */,
});
```
* __Arguments :__  A single hash of parameters with three properties.


    * __`options` [object] :__ a hash of values corresponding to set-interval's CLI flags. __Required.__
    
        * `command` __[string] :__ the shell command to execute. __Required.__
        
        * `time` __[number] :__ the number of seconds between calls. __Required.__
        
        * `reps` __[number] :__ a number of total shell calls to make.  After this number is reached, the interval will be cleared. _Optional._
        
        * `eager` __[boolean] :__ whether to immediately execute the function once before starting the timer. _Optional._
        
        * `quiet` __[boolean] :__ when used with the default `onExec` handler, tells set-interval not to print `stdout` to the terminal. _Optional._

    * `onExec` __[function] :__ a callback to handle data returned from shell command execution.  It is invoked once for each shell call and receives `err`, `stdout`, and `stderr` as its arguments. _Optional._
    
    * `onFinish` __[function] :__ when a limited number of repetitions is specified(in `options.reps`), this callback is invoked after the last shell call has returned a value and been handled. _Optional. Only has an effect if `reps` is specified._

* __Return Value__: a reference to the Node.js `timeoutId` assigned to shell-interval's internal timer.  This can be used with `clearInterval(<id>)` to stop executing the shell command.  

([See the Node.js documentation on __timeoutId__.](http://nodejs.org/api/timers.html))
    
    
    
####Basic Usage
Both callbacks are optional, but the hash of parameters passed in must contain an `options` property.  `options` itself must be a hash containing at least `command` and `time` properties.

```js
shellInterval({
    options: {
        command: "echo Hello.",
        time: 5,
    },
});

// echoes "Hello" in the terminal every five seconds
// until a break signal is received.

```
More usefully, client code can supply two optional callback functions: one for each of the `onExec` and `onFinish` events.

* `onExec` is invoked once for every execution of the shell command, and receives `err`, `stdout` and `stderr` as its arguments. 
* `onFinish` is only called if a finite number of repetitions has been specified (via `options.reps` in node or `-r <number>` in the shell).  In this case it is called exactly once, **after** the last callback has returned its value and been handled.  It does not receive any arguments.


```js
shellInterval({
            options: {
                command: "echo Hello.",
                time: 2,
                reps: 3,
            },
            onExec: function(err, stdout, stderr) {
                if (err) throw err;
                console.log("Output: " + stdout);
            },
            onFinish: function() {
                console.log("Finished.")                
            },           
});
```
The default `onExec` handler logs the shell response to the terminal unless the `--quiet` flag is passed.  Because this default handler is overridden by passing in a callback, the `--quiet` flag will not affect the behavior of a client-provided function.



####Usage in Place of `setInterval`
The function exported by `shell-interval` returns the Node `timeoutId` set by shell-interval internally, it can be used as a transparent replacement for a `setInterval` call in many cases where periodic shell execution is needed.  Most importantly, the return value can be passed to the normal `clearInterval` function to stop executing the shell command.

```js
var shellInterval = require("shell-interval");

var intervalId = shellInterval({
                options: {
                    command: "echo Hello.",
                    time: 5,
                },
                onExec: function(err, stdout, stderr) {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log(stdout);
                    if( /* some condition */ ) {
                        clearInterval(intervalId);
                    }
                },
});
```

##Use Cases
__shell-interval__ provides similar functionality to [watch](https://github.com/visionmedia/watch), but in native Javascript and with a programmatic interface for Node.

Timed shell calls can be paired with a target- and dependency-based build program like [make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to produce a flexible, automatic build system with far less configuration than e.g. [grunt-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch).
```shell
$   shell-interval -c "make" -t 10

make: nothing to be done for 'all'.     #[0:10]
make: nothing to be done for 'all'.     #[0:20]


    # a dependency is changed between 0:20 and 0:30
    
jshint ./modules/*.js                  #[0:30]
cat ./modules/*.js > ./build/out.js    #[0:36]
mocha test ./build/spec                #[0:41]

make: noting to be done for 'all'.     #[0:50]
make: noting to be done for 'all'.     #[1:00]
# ... ad infinitum

```
